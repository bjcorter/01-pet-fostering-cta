      <h2>Why Foster a Pet?</h2>
      <p>Fostering a pet provides them with a temporary home and the love they need while waiting for adoption. It's a rewarding experience that saves lives and brings joy to both you and the animals.</p>
      <p>By fostering, you help reduce overcrowding in shelters and give pets a better chance of finding their forever homes. It's a meaningful way to make a difference in the lives of animals in need.</p>
